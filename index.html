                        <p class="text-light">
                            The following is a relatively small, local study on the general relationship between
                            income and happiness. The analysis proposed here takes into consideration
                            <a target = "_blank" class = "text-light" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_boroughs#List_of_boroughs">
                                <u>London boroughs</u>
                            </a> only, focusing on a number of metrics such as mean and median incomes,
                            as well as average happiness indices for each borough. The data used here was extracted from
                            datasets kindly provided by the <b>HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)</b>, and the <b>Office for National Statistics (ONS)</b>, respectively.
                            For more information, please see the <a class = "text-light " href = "#acknowledgements-panel"><u>acknowledgements</u></a> section.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-light"> The following two visualisations were built for the study. </p>


                        <h6 class="bold"><a class = "text-light" href = "#income-panel"><u>Income Variation by Borough</u>:</a></h6>
                        <p class="text-light">
                            This first tool consists of a line chart showing income variation throughout the years, for each
                            borough in particular. Choose your desired borough from the dropdown menu on the left, and the
                            chart will automatically refresh to display metrics for that borough. Moreover, options for mean
                            and median incomes are available on the right. Note how, by changing these, the income scale
                            updates as well, as median incomes are significantly smaller than the mean ones. Last but not
                            least, by moving the mouse cursor over a particualr data point, a tooltip with the exact income
                            value for the particular year is shown.
                        </p>

                        <h6 class="bold"><a class = "text-light" href = "#income-happiness-panel"><u>Relationship Between Income and Happiness</u>:</a></h6>
                        <p class="text-light">
                            This second, more complex tool, is a bubble chart showing the relation between income and general
                            levels of happiness of people living in each borough. The (mean) income data is shared with the
                            first visualisation, while average happiness indices were extracted from the ONS dataset
                            discussed above. As opposed to the first chart, here the selection is based on years, and all
                            the boroughs are scattered on the canvas at once, for each year. Note how the bubble areas are
                            proportional to the number of tax payers for the associated boroughs. As before, hovering the
                            mouse pointer over each bubble is going to provide the exact metrics associated with it.
                            Last but not least, an optional regression line clarifies the overall trend of the relation.

                            Unfortunately, the City of London (not officialy a borough anyways) was exluded from this latter
                            chart, as data with regards to happiness levels was insufficient.

                            As we can see from the chart above, and perhaps not surprisingly, boroughs such as Kensington
                            and Chelesea, the City of London, and Westminster show the largest income values per capita,
                            with means ranging from £46,400 to £178,000 throughout the years.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-light">
                            Camden, Richmond, and Hammersmith and Fulham settle in the middle region, with average incomes
                            between £34,900 and £88,000 in the considered time frame.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-light">
                            While on the other hand, the overwhelming majority of boroughs (27 more) lay on the lower spectrum
                            when it comes to incomes, with average values as low as £15,800 (Newham in year 2000). It is also interesting
                            to note how highest income values in the lower-range boroughs do not manage to reach up to the mimimums
                            of higher-range boroughs, showing an immense disparity amongst areas.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-light">
                            Contrarily, the disparity between happiness values is not as large,
                            as we will have the opportunity to see in the following analysis.

                            The above visualisation is perhaps even more interesting than the previous one. Bubble Plots
                            make in fact for very powerful tools, that allow for the visualisation of three-dimensional
                            data. Here such three dimentions are represented by:
                        </p>

                        <ol class = "text-light">

                        </ol>

                        <p class="text-light">
                            A fourth, temporal dimension was also provided here, as the plot can be adjusted to display data
                            for any of the available years. This allows for a more complete picture of the situation,
                            as analogies and contrasts can be spotted throughout time.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-light">
                            In addition, to further increase the visual richness of the tool, colour coding was used, with
                            <span class = "bold outer">orange bubbles</span> representing outer boroughs, and
                            <span class="bold inner">yellow ones</span> representing inner boroughs. Note how, since these
                            can obstruct one another (due to the closeness of their values), zooming functionality was
                            also provied along the x axis.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-light">
                            As for the original set of questions that very much defined the scope of this study itself:
                        </p>

                        <ul class = "text-light">
                            <li>"<i>Is there a relationship between wealth and contentment?</i>"</li>
                            <li>"<i>Does money make people happier?</i>"</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="text-light">
                            This plot cannot give a definitive answer, but it sure can provide us with some clues:
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-light">
                            First of all, by scrolling through the years, we can notice how general happiness indices
                            tend to raise, bringing the bubbles more and more towards the upper area of the chart. This
                            is particularly observable when switching directly from year 2012 to year 2017.
                            <br>In addition, as we know from our previous visualisation, income values also had an ascending
                            trend through the years. This seems to confirm a first positive relations between wealth
                            and contentment, at least through time.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-light">
                            Likewise, with the aid of the linear regression tool, we can observe a positive correlation between
                            income and happiness on a year-by-year basis as well, with generally positive trends. Note how
                            this is not the case for year 2015, which is characterised by a slightly negative correlation.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-light">
                            Needless to say, correlation does not imply causality, and 2015 was probably influenced by
                            other factors. That is however beyond the scope of this study, which was always limited to
                            one factor only.
