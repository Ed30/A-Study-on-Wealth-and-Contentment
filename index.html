                        <p class="text-light">
                            The following is a relatively small, local study on the general relationaship between
                            income and happiness. The analysis proposed here takes into consideration
                            <a target = "_blank" class = "text-light" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_boroughs#List_of_boroughs">
                                <u>London boroughs</u>
                            </a> only, focusing on a number of metrics such as mean and median incomes,
                            as well as average happiness indices for each borough. The data used here was extracted from
                            datasets kindly provided by the <b>HM Revenue & Customs</b>, and the <b>Office for National Statistics (ONS)</b>, respectively.
                            For more information, please head over to the <a class = "text-light " href = "#acknowledgements-panel"><u>acknowledgements</u></a> section.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-light"> The following two visualisations were built for the study. </p>


                        <h6 class="bold"><a class = "text-light" href = "#income-panel"><u>Income Variation by Borough</u>:</a></h6>
                        <p class="text-light">
                            This first tool consists of a line chart showing income variation throughout the years, for each
                            borough in particular. Choose your desired borough from the dropdown menu on the left, and the
                            chart will automatically refresh to display metrics for that borough. Moreover, options for mean
                            and median incomes are available on the right. Note how, by changing these, the income scale
                            updates as well, as median incomes are significantly smaller than the mean ones. Last but not
                            least, by moving the mouse cursor over a particualr data point, a tooltip with the exact income
                            value for the particular year is shown.
                        </p>

                        <h6 class="bold"><a class = "text-light" href = "#income-happiness-panel"><u>Relationship Between Income and Happiness</u>:</a></h6>
                        <p class="text-light">
                            This second, more complex tool, is a bubble chart showing the relation between income and general
                            levels of happiness of people living in each borough. The (mean) income data is shared with the
                            first visualisation, while average happiness indices were extracted from the ONS dataset
                            discussed above. As opposed to the first chart, here the selection is based on years, and all
                            the boroughs are scattered on the canvas at once, for each year. Note how the bubble areas are
                            proportional to the number of tax payers for the associated boroughs. As before, hovering the
                            mouse pointer over each bubble is going to provide the exact metrics associated with it.
                            Last but not least, an optional regression line clarifies the overall trend of the relation.

                            Unfortunately, the City of London (not officialy a borough anyways) was exluded from this latter
                            chart, as data with regards to happiness levels was insufficient.
